# Unsupervised_Learning
# Basic implementation of some of the Unsupervised machine learning techniques in Python
## All the projects are from Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree Program.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
